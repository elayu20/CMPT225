FIFO (First in, First out)
Use queues to store data for files to be printed by a shared printer
	- printer prints files in order when received, (first in, first printed)
Create two classes for print queue
	- request class (student id, time, etc)
	- container class to store requestes
Items inserted at back, removed from front
Can use for server requests
Standard Template Library include queue implementation

Array implementation for queue
	Make back of queue current size of array
	Make front of queue index 0
	Inserting items are easy, becomes new back
What happens when items are removed?
	Either move all remaining items down - very slow
	Increment front index - wastes space
